You've provided an excellent `README.md` already\! It's clear, well-structured, and covers all the essential aspects of your project. The use of headings, code blocks, and clear instructions makes it very user-friendly.

I've made a few minor tweaks to enhance readability and ensure consistency, but the core structure and content remain the same as your excellent original.

# 🚀 AI-Powered SAP Ticket Classifier (FastAPI + Retrainable Model)

This project leverages **deep learning** and **FastAPI** to classify SAP support tickets in real time. Given a ticket's **subject** and **content**, it predicts:

  * 📂 **Module**: (e.g., SD, MM, HCM, FICO)
  * 📝 **Request Type**: (e.g., Incident, Service Request, CR Modification)

-----

## 📁 Project Structure

```

├── ticket_data.csv          # Training dataset
├── train_models.py          # Script to retrain and save models
├── main.py                  # FastAPI backend for real-time prediction
├── tokenizer.json           # Tokenizer file (auto-generated)

## 🛠️ Installation

Ensure **Python 3.10+** is installed.

Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn tensorflow fastapi uvicorn
```

-----

## 📊 Dataset Format

The `ticket_data.csv` file must include these columns:

| subject         | content                               | module | request\_type   |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------ | :----- | :-------------- |
| Login Issue     | Users can't access ESS after update   | HCM    | Incident        |
| Price Problem   | Issue with pricing condition in order | SD     | Service Request |

Make sure your dataset has enough examples for each class to ensure robust model performance.

-----

## 🏋️‍♂️ Step 1: Retrain the Models

Run the following command to train both models and generate the required files:

```bash
python train_models.py
```

> ✅ This process will generate the following files in the `AiModel/` directory:
>
>   * `tokenizer.json`
>   * `module_model.h5`
>   * `request_type_model.h5`

-----

## 🚀 Step 2: Start FastAPI Server

Run the API server using Uvicorn:

```bash
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The server will start at:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

## 🔍 Sample Prediction Request

### Endpoint

```
POST /predict
```

### JSON Body

```json
{
  "subject": "INC-90001 ESS Login Issue",
  "content": "Employees are unable to login to the ESS portal since morning."
}
```

### Response

```json
{
  "module": "HCM",
  "request_type": "Incident"
}
```

-----

## 💡 Important Notes

  * Always re-run `train_models.py` if you update your `ticket_data.csv` to ensure your models are trained on the latest data.
  * The current models utilize a simple LSTM-based architecture for text classification.
  * The `tokenizer.json` file is crucial and must correspond to the vocabulary used during the training phase.

-----

## 🌱 Future Ideas

  * Integrate more advanced NLP models like **BERT** or **DistilBERT** for improved classification accuracy.
  * Develop a user interface using frameworks such as **Streamlit** or **React** for a more interactive experience.
  * Implement centralized storage for models and tokenizers (e.g., **AWS S3** or a **database**) to facilitate easier deployment and management.
