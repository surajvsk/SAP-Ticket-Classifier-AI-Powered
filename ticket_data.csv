Correction in report ZFIR14,"As per our discussion on MST yesterday, please refer to the following points to be covered in the ZFIR14 report and enclosed testcase details.

1.	Bill Type: ZDEM (Deemed SEZ Export Invoice) – The Taxable Value field is incorrect. The Quantity value is appearing in the Taxable Value column.
2.	Bill Type: ZLIC (License Invoice) – The value appearing in both the Invoice and Taxable Value columns is incorrect.
3.	Bill Type: ZDR (Debit Invoice) – The values in both the Invoice and Taxable Value columns are incorrect.
4.	Export-related invoices – The exchange rate is being taken as ""Custom Exchange Rate,"" which is maintained by the material line of the item.
5.	Required Bill Types – The report should include the following bill types: ""Export Tax Invoice,"" ""Export Rebate Tax Invoice,"" ""Sample Sales Invoice,"" and ""Return Invoice Export Port - Plant.""
6.	Required Columns – The report should include columns for ""Bill-to Party,"" with both Name and Code, GST Number, Region Code, and Region Name.
7.	GST Value – In the generated ZFIR14 report, the total GST value is showing as negative. We require the sum of IGST, CGST, and SGST to be shown instead.
8.	Multiple Line Items – If there are multiple line items, the values should be split accordingly for each line item.
9.	Taxable Value Calculation – If the GST value is 0 (zero), the taxable value should be equal to the invoice value. If the GST value is not 0, then the invoice value should be the sum of the Taxable Value and GST value.",SD,Modification
Request to Resolve Issues in Report ZSDR07,"1.	Invoice Number: 3251020107
In this invoice, billing has been done for two batches of the same material. In report ZSDR07, I have implemented a logic where, if multiple batches exist for the same material, they are clubbed and displayed as a single line item.
However, the Assessable Value (Condition Type: ZASV) is not being clubbed correctly, due to which the report is now showing two line items instead of one when multiple batches are present.
2.	Invoice Number: 3251200012
For this invoice, the Net Value is appearing as zero in the report, while the printout displays the correct value. Kindly investigate and correct the discrepancy.",SD,Modification
Request for Customer Outstanding Report – Material,"We require a Customer Outstanding Report material-wise for analysis purposes.
Kindly provide the report with the following details:
•	Customer Name/Code
•	Material Code & Description

•	Quantity & Amount
•	Pending Amount (Open Items)
•	Aging, if available
Please share the data for the current financial year or as per availability in the system.
Let me know if any clarification is needed.

Hi Sufiyan,
&nbsp;
I have checked helpdesk portal and found that till now no ticket is assigned to you of Sheel Chand client.

&nbsp;
As per my understanding, Gopal Sir had assigned you a task to change the Business Area from mandatory to optional. This task was not that much time consuming.
&nbsp;
I suggest you to enhance your technical execution speed without compromising quality and also priorities task effectively to meet the deadline.

&nbsp;
Please treat this as an opportunity for growth and improvement.

&nbsp;

Dear Mr. Prakash,


&nbsp;


There is a custom validation which compares condition record price with price in PO; but there is no filter to pick the condition record maintained for the valid date.


&nbsp;


So, even though the PO is picking up the condition record price of 107.78; the custom validation is comparing the PO price of 107.78 to the old condition record price of 107.72 and showing error message.


&nbsp;


It is recommended to add date as condition while validating price in PO so that it compares the price with the valid condition record.


&nbsp;


&nbsp;

&nbsp;


&nbsp;

Thanks and Regards,
&nbsp;

Dear Prakash,


&nbsp;


As discussed, we have added the date as a condition while validating the price in the PO,&nbsp;so that it compares the price with the valid condition record.


&nbsp;


Kindly check and share your feedback on the same.

&nbsp;

Dear Mr. Prakash,


&nbsp;


There is a custom validation which compares condition record price with price in PO; but there is no filter to pick the condition record maintained for the valid date.


&nbsp;


So, even though the PO is picking up the condition record price of 107.78; the custom validation is comparing the PO price of 107.78 to the old condition record price of 107.72 and showing error message.


&nbsp;


It is recommended to add date as condition while validating price in PO so that it compares the price with the valid condition record.


&nbsp;


&nbsp;

&nbsp;


&nbsp;

Thanks and Regards,
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Dear Mr. Prakash,


&nbsp;


There is a custom validation which compares condition record price with price in PO; but there is no filter to pick the condition record maintained for the valid date.


&nbsp;


So, even though the PO is picking up the condition record price of 107.78; the custom validation is comparing the PO price of 107.78 to the old condition record price of 107.72 and showing error message.


&nbsp;


It is recommended to add date as condition while validating price in PO so that it compares the price with the valid condition record.


&nbsp;


&nbsp;

&nbsp;


&nbsp;

Thanks and Regards,
&nbsp;

It is recommended to add date as condition while validating price in PO so that it compares the price with the valid condition record.

RE: Required Standard Len & Standard Width column in YPP12_1003 Program,"







Hi Sufiyan,
&nbsp;
The task of making business area as optional was assigned to you yesterday i.e 25.06.2025 at
12:33 PM, you took up the task at 05:07 PM and the same is delivered by you today i.e. 26.06.2025 at 3:40 PM.
&nbsp;
Such timelines for minor changes is affecting our deliverables. Today, we also received an escalation from the Rimjhim client, highlighting that their issues—despite being small—are not being addressed
 in a timely manner. This reflects poorly on our delivery. Being a senior ABAPer you should resolve minor changes quickly, which will be a good example for Junior ABAPers.
&nbsp;
I again suggest you to take this feedback seriously and work on improving your performance to avoid further escalations.

&nbsp;
Thanks and Regards,
&nbsp;

Hi Sufiyan,
&nbsp;
I have checked helpdesk portal and found that till now no ticket is assigned to you of Sheel Chand client.

&nbsp;
As per my understanding, Gopal Sir had assigned you a task to change the Business Area from mandatory to optional. This task was not that much time consuming.
&nbsp;
I suggest you to enhance your technical execution speed without compromising quality and also priorities task effectively to meet the deadline.

&nbsp;
Please treat this as an opportunity for growth and improvement.

Hi Sufiyan,
&nbsp;
The task of making business area as optional was assigned to you yesterday i.e 25.06.2025 at
12:33 PM, you took up the task at 05:07 PM and the same is delivered by you today i.e. 26.06.2025 at 3:40 PM.
&nbsp;
Such timelines for minor changes is affecting our deliverables. Today, we also received an escalation from the Rimjhim client, highlighting that their issues—despite being small—are not being
 addressed in a timely manner. This reflects poorly on our delivery. Being a senior ABAPer you should resolve minor changes quickly, which will be a good example for Junior ABAPers.
&nbsp;
I again suggest you to take this feedback seriously and work on improving your performance to avoid further escalations.

&nbsp;
Thanks and Regards,
&nbsp;

Hi Sufiyan,
&nbsp;
I have checked helpdesk portal and found that till now no ticket is assigned to you of Sheel Chand client.

&nbsp;
As per my understanding, Gopal Sir had assigned you a task to change the Business Area from mandatory to optional. This task was not that much time consuming.
&nbsp;
I suggest you to enhance your technical execution speed without compromising quality and also priorities task effectively to meet the deadline.

&nbsp;
Please treat this as an opportunity for growth and improvement.

Hi Sufiyan,
&nbsp;
On 26-06-2025, you started the task in the morning, yet it took more than 6 hours to complete a small change.

&nbsp;
Please analyze your work performance to improve efficiency and meet deadlines effectively.

&nbsp;
Thanks and Regards,
&nbsp;

Hi Sufiyan,
&nbsp;
The task of making business area as optional was assigned to you yesterday i.e 25.06.2025 at
12:33 PM, you took up the task at 05:07 PM and the same is delivered by you today i.e. 26.06.2025 at 3:40 PM.
&nbsp;
Such timelines for minor changes is affecting our deliverables. Today, we also received an escalation from the Rimjhim client, highlighting that their issues—despite being small—are not being addressed
 in a timely manner. This reflects poorly on our delivery. Being a senior ABAPer you should resolve minor changes quickly, which will be a good example for Junior ABAPers.
&nbsp;
I again suggest you to take this feedback seriously and work on improving your performance to avoid further escalations.

&nbsp;
Thanks and Regards,
&nbsp;

Hi Sufiyan,
&nbsp;
I have checked helpdesk portal and found that till now no ticket is assigned to you of Sheel Chand client.

&nbsp;
As per my understanding, Gopal Sir had assigned you a task to change the Business Area from mandatory to optional. This task was not that much time consuming.
&nbsp;
I suggest you to enhance your technical execution speed without compromising quality and also priorities task effectively to meet the deadline.

&nbsp;
Please treat this as an opportunity for growth and improvement.

Dear Shreekant,

He is a senior ABAPer and is already allocated to the helpdesk team. This has already been communicated earlier.

Hi Neeraj,




The requirement was to make business area option in&nbsp;standard Tcode : F-53 and F-28.&nbsp;




The actual code I written is just 2 to 3 lines, but identifying the right enhancement point or BADI can be time-consuming.





Thanks and Regards,

Dear Shreekant,

There are currently three ABAPers working on the helpdesk. Please assign the ticket to Sufiyan.
